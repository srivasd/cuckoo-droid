=====================================
Creation of the Linux Virtual Machine
=====================================

Once you have `properly installed`_ your virtualization
software, you can create all the virtual machines you need.

Please refer to the official documentation, as the use and configuration of virtualization software is beyond the scope of this
guide.

    .. note::

        Hints and considerations on how to design and create
        your virtualized environment can be found in the :doc:`../../introduction/sandboxing`
        chapter.

    .. note::

		Cuckoo Sandbox can work with any Linux distribution. For analysis purposes, use Ubuntu Linux 12.04.05.
		


Cuckoo doesn't require any specific configuration to create the virtual machine. Choose the options that best fit your needs.
