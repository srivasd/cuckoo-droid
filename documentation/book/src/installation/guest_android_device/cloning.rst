Cloning the Virtual Machine
===========================

If you want to use more than one virtual machine, there's no need to
repeat all the steps done so far: you can clone it. This way, you'll have
a copy of the original virtualized Windows with all of the requirements already
installed.

However, the clone will also contain all the settings of the original virtual machine. Repeat the steps explained in
:doc:`network`, and :doc:`saving` for this new machine.
