Creation of the Linux Virtual Machine
=====================================

Once you have `properly installed`_ your virtualization
software, you can create all the virtual machines you need.

Using and configuring your virtualization software is beyond the scope of this
guide, so please refer to the official documentation.

    .. note::

        Hints and considerations on how to design and create
        your virtualized environment can be found in the :doc:`../../introduction/sandboxing`
        chapter.

    .. note::

		Cuckoo Sandbox works with any Android x86 port versions. For analysis purposes, use Android x86 4.4 RC2.
		Download the ``.iso`` from the `official website`_.
